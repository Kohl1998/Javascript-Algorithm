# Javascript Algorithm 

## Description

For this application I built an algorithm that would calculate the tax a sport's team is required to pay for signing 3 football players. 

I did this by creating variables to assign data, and arithmetic calculations to work out how much the team exceeded their spending budget which I applied the tax percentage too. 

The motivation for building this algorithm came because I realised I could save the coaches significant time, and effort. 

## Installation

I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code, but also see the code in action using the live server extension. 

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.

## Features

For this application the tax owed can be viewed using a browser such as Google chrome or even Microsoft edge. 

To access the information, right click on a mouse if you are using a PC or press the touchpad on a laptop. Once you do this, you will see an option at the bottom with 'inspect'. 

Click this option and then look at the top of the HTML file, and you will see a symbol with '>>', which will have the option 'console'. Click this and you will find the information.
